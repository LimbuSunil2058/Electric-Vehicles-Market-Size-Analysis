# üöó Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis using Python

This project explores the global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) using real-world data. It aims to uncover how EV adoption has evolved over time, which countries are leading the charge, and how technological advancements like battery range are progressing.

## üìä Project Overview

The analysis includes:
- Cleaning and preparing real-world EV registration data
- Understanding trends in EV adoption over the years
- Identifying top countries and cities for EV usage
- Analyzing distribution of EV types (BEV, PHEV, etc.)
- Exploring electric range progression over model years
- Finding correlation between year and EV adoption

## üìÅ Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed records about electric vehicles registered in the U.S. (primarily Washington state). Below are the key fields:

- **VIN (1-10)**: Partial Vehicle Identification Number.
- **County**: County where the vehicle is registered.
- **City**: City where the vehicle is registered.
- **State**: State where the vehicle is registered (mostly WA).
- **Postal Code**: Postal (ZIP) code of registration.
- **Model Year**: Year of the vehicle model.
- **Make**: Manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Tesla, Nissan).
- **Model**: Model name of the vehicle (e.g., Leaf, Model S).
- **Electric Vehicle Type**: Type of EV ‚Äì e.g., Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV).
- **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility**: Indicates if the vehicle qualifies for clean fuel programs.
- **Electric Range**: Distance the EV can travel on a full charge (in miles).
- **Base MSRP**: Manufacturer‚Äôs Suggested Retail Price.
- **Legislative District**: District of vehicle registration.
- **DOL Vehicle ID**: Washington State Department of Licensing vehicle ID.
- **Vehicle Location**: Latitude and longitude coordinates.
- **Electric Utility**: Name of the electric utility provider for the location.
- **2020 Census Tract**: Census tract code based on 2020 U.S. Census data.
